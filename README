Krita brush bundles
===================

This repo contains several brush bundles for Krita (http://krita.org). Some of
them were created by me, but as for most, i just packed them.

Bundles are to be built by my krita-bundler script (https://github.com/portnov/krita-bundler).
To build a bundle, just chdir to needed directory and say

    $ create-krita-bundle.py *.bundleconfig

This will create *.bundle file which you can import into Krita.
